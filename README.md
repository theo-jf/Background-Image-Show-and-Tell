# Background Image Show and Tell

Here are some fun things you can do with background images! 
I spent a lot of time fiddling with this during our Week 6 assignment, so this will showcase both traditional and more specific tricks. 

## What You'll Find

* After opening `index.html` you'll see three garages, **scroll around** and **resize** the page to see what you notice
* Afterwards, comments can be found in `style.css` for explanations
* Make the recommended styling changes to see how they affect the page, and feel free to experiment more to you heart's desire!
